# Altitude Changes (Q1)

Simple altimeter app that uses the pressure sensor to estimate altitude in real time.

- Reads pressure data, converts to altitude using the standard barometric formula (P0 = 1013.25 hPa).
- Simulates pressure changes in the emulator to watch the altimeter update live.
- UI background darkens as altitude increases for quick visual feedback.
- Basic gauge/number readout shows current altitude.
